        History Of Dasuya
    </h1>
    <p class="welcomebelow"
        style="margin-top: 5px"; padding-top: 45px; border-radius: 25px; font-family:monospace;>
        <strong style="font-size: 40px; font-family:monospace;"> A</strong> According to a report by The Tribune
        newspaper in 1977, the town is referred to in the ancient Indian epic, the Mahabharata, as being the seat of
        king Virata. In recognition of this, Dasuya is still referred to as Virat Ki Nagri today. <br>

        In the closing decade of the fourteenth century, Dasuya at least twice witnessed the passage of an army during
        the struggle against the Muslim conquerors, Abu Bakar and Amir Taimur. Later, in December 1557, the army of
        the incumbent Sultan Akbar, led by his governor of Lahore, Khizr Khan, camped at the town while dealing
        successfully with a threat posed by Sikandar Sur.
        <br>

        More recently, Dasuya featured in debates related to the emergence of Himachal Pradesh. Verma has noted that
        "Perhaps no other State of India has suffered as many territorial and political changes in recent times as the
        Punjab". Within the process of the linguistic reorganization of states, the claim that Dasuya should be
        incorporated into Himachal Pradesh on the grounds that it was the home of Dogras was rejected because that point
        was irrelevant to the linguistic issue. Dasuya remained in Punjab when the negotiations culminated in the Punjab
        Reorganisation Act of 1966.
